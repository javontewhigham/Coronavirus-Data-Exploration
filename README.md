### Coronavirus Data Exploration

+ This project was designed to query a data set to find out different statistics that happend in occurance to real life events.
  Covid-19 shocked the world in 2020 and eventually caused the death and sickness of millions of people around the world.
  It then eventually led to millions of people getting vaccinated against the deadly virus.
  The data set I queried contains data in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic such as the amount of people infected, amount of people that died from the virus, and amount of people that became vaccinated, per location, such as country and continent.
  The data set I used can be found at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths under the section 'Daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people', as I could not upload the data sets because of their size.
